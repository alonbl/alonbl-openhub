Python Unidecode
          Description:   It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent it in ASCII.

In most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as "???" or "\15BA\15A0\1610", to mention two extreme cases. But that's nearly useless to someone who actually wants to read what the text says.

What Unidecode provides is a middle road: function unidecode() takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human with a US keyboard would choose.

RESTEasy
          Description:   RESTEasy is a JBoss project that provides various frameworks to help you build RESTful Web Services and RESTful Java applications. It is a fully certified and portable implementation of the JAX-RS specification. JAX-RS is a new JCP specification that provides a Java API for RESTful Web Services over the HTTP protocol.

RESTEasy can run in any Servlet container, but tighter integration with the JBoss Application Server is also available to make the user experience nicer in that environment. While JAX-RS is only a server-side specification, RESTEasy has innovated to bring JAX-RS to the client through the RESTEasy JAX-RS Client Framework. This client-side framework allows you to map outgoing HTTP requests to remote servers using JAX-RS annotations and interface proxies.

WireGuard VPN Tunnel
          Description:   WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it plans to be cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.

eCryptfs
          Description:   eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant enterprise-class stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux. It is derived from Erez Zadok's Cryptfs, implemented through the FiST framework for generating stacked filesystems. eCryptfs extends Cryptfs to provide advanced key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional information aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself. Think of eCryptfs as a sort of ``gnupgfs.''

iprange
          Description:   The fastest way to manage files with IPs, subnets and hostnames.

why to use it over any other aggregate

It is simpler than any other aggregate.
It supports many input formats, all together in the same file.
It is faster, actually a lot faster.
Can reduce the subnets/prefixes to produce high-performing netfilter/iptables ipsets.
Can compare files with IPs to find if they overlap and to what degree.
Can find the IPs common to a set of files.
Can exclude IPs (merge a set of files while excluding all IPs matched by another set of files).

This tool is behind the scenes of http://iplists.firehol.org
